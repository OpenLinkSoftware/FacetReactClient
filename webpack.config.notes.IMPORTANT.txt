webpack output is served from devServer.publicPath
Content not from webpack is served from devServer.contentBase

devServer.publicPath - determines where a BUNDLES (i.e. webpack output) is served from
devServer.contentBase - determines where STATIC FILES are served from

output.path = Local disk directory to store all your webpack-generated output files (Absolute path).

output.publicPath = Where you uploaded your bundled files. (Relative to web server root)
Example: /assets/
Assumed you deployed the app at server root http://server/.
By using /assets/, the app will find webpack assets at: http://server/assets/. Under the hood, every urls that webpack encounters will be re-written to begin with "/assets/".
e.g. src="picture.jpg", Re-written as: src="/assets/picture.jpg", Accessed by: http://server/assets/picture.jpg


1) output.publicPath: must exist

2) output.publicPath: "/" - effectively disables publicPath.

3) output.publicPath: is used as the search location when looking for a bundle
e.g. if index.html includes assets/bundle.js, the server will look for {publicPath}/assets/bundle.js



devServer.contentBase - set to folder containing index.html.
	e.g. contentBase: __dirname + "/public/",

devServer.contentBase
- tells webpack dev server where to serve only *static* files from (not the URL they will be served as). 
- when you are working with webpack-dev-server, it generates dynamic output (a bundle) in memory, so you don't have static content to serve.

- It must be a relative or absolute path. The server doesn't automatially use your project as the root directory, so 
  contentBase: "/dist" - won't resolve
  contentBase: __dirname + '/dist' - should resolve

devServer.publicPath - only relevant to bundled files, not static content.

webpack-dev-server only serves from memory if the correct path is hit.
